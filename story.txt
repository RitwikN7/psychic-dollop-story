There was a prisoner being transported to Helgen for execution. He'd gotten caught up in an Imperial ambush and got knocked out. But, when the executioner was ready to strike, a dragon attacked.

The dragon spewed out a long, scalding flame. The prisoner braced as well as he could, but chains restricted his movement. The flames shot past him. The executioner was cooked alive inside of his armor. The prisoner looked up and saw a man perched atop the dragon...


Shaokang Jiang: There is a man in Lu who is good at weaving straw sandals and his wife is good at weaving white silk. He wants to move to Vietnam. My friend said to him, "if you go to Vietnam, you will be poor." "Why?" "Straw sandals are used for walking, but Yue people are used to walking barefoot; white silk is used to make hats, but Yue people are used to hair. Is it possible to go where you can't use yourself by virtue of your strengths, so that you won't be poor? " Nothing to add.

Osase Noma-Owens: The dragon realized that it was stuck in the game called Skyrim and it then decided to pull off what we call a "pro gamer move"...

Final commit
